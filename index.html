      <h1>PLACES JAYLA WANTS TO TRAVEL</h1>
        <p>Jayla would honestyly travel anywhere. I love tropical climates, I loves snowy, col, winter places. I love fall when the leaves are falling. </p>

         <h2>Bora Bora</h2>
         <P> I would want to go here because it is literally just perfect. I want to stay in a water bungalow so that I can swim whenever, wherever I want.
          Bora Bora is a popular destination for honeymoons and luxury travel but when I go I'll be getting to the water and stay there forever. There 
          are activities like snorkeling, scuba diving with sharks, and relaxing on white sand beaches drinking unlimited pina coladas. 
        </p>
