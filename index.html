      <h1>PLACES JAYLA WANTS TO TRAVEL</h1>
        <p>Jayla would honestyly travel anywhere. I love tropical climates, I loves snowy, col, winter places. I love fall when the leaves are falling. </p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h2 id="bora">Bora Bora</h2>
         <P> I would want to go here because it is literally just perfect. I want to stay in a water bungalow so that I can swim whenever, wherever I want.
          Bora Bora is a popular destination for honeymoons and luxury travel but when I go I'll be getting to the water and stay there forever. There 
          are activities like snorkeling, scuba diving with sharks, and relaxing on white sand beaches drinking unlimited pina coladas. 
        </p>

         <h2 id="swiss">Switzerland</h2>
         <p> Switzerland is such a naturally beautiful place. I would go buy some <class="brown">rich, delicious chocolates</class> and just listen to my music and stare at the 
          beautiful mountains and scenery, watch the sunset and stare at the stars.
         </p>

        <h2 id="thai">Thailand</h2>
         <p> Thailand is a Southeast Asian country. It's known for tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples displaying 
          figures of Buddha. You get a mix of city, culture, beaches and all the best things in one.
